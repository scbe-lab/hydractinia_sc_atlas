Notebooks contain the necesary code to run: 

	1. Library analyses, preproccesing and initial clustering. 
	2. Compositional analyses of the annotated clusters.
	3. Transcription factor annotation, analysis, Coocurrence matrix and WGCNA pipeline.
	4. Shematrin repeat finder custom code and *Stylophora* metacell score. 

All analyses were run using Jupyter Notebook with Python v3 and R v4.1 in Windows OS 8 and Ubuntu GNU/Linux. All packages used are fully described in the methods section of the manuscript.
